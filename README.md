Shows a message in raid/party and on your screen when you join with a blacklisted player.

 

Github source is updated every night at midnight to keep the list up to date with the latest blacklisted players.  

 

Please Report players at  https://discord.gg/benediction

 

You can also appeal and reports at the above discord link.

 

Typing '/beneblack' in chat will display the last time your blacklist was updated.

Adding 'check' after the command to make '/beneblack check', will reset your local blacklist and check the party again for any blacklisted players.  And will say in party chat if anyone is on the blacklist or if your party is good.
