Shows a message in raid/party and on your screen when you join with a blacklisted player or guild.

Also checks for blacklisted players when you open trade.  (Does not support blacklisted guilds on trade, still recommend adding to group)


Github source is updated every night at midnight to keep the list up to date with the latest blacklisted players.



Please Report players on your server discord or over at https://discord.gg/FCCdCnEF4d

Typing '/beneblack' in chat will display the last time your blacklist was updated.

Typing '/beneblack check', will recheck check the party again for any blacklisted players. Will also post in party chat if anyone is on the blacklist or if your party is clear of known blacklisted players.

Typing '/beneblack silent', will enable silent mode.
Also joining any battleground will also enable silent mode.

While in silent mode, no messages will be sent in party/raid chat; but you will still recieve personal notifications of blacklisted players/guilds.

Also, if you run into / or are using this addon on an unsupported realm, it will notify you that you are on an unsupported realm.
