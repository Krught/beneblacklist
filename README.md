Shows a message in raid/party and on your screen when you join with a blacklisted player or guild.

Also checks for blacklisted players when you open trade. (Does not support blacklisted guilds on trade, still recommend adding to group)

 

Github source is updated every night at midnight to keep the list up to date with the latest blacklisted players.

 

Please Report players on your server discord or over at https://discord.gg/FCCdCnEF4d

 

Supported Servers:

If your server doesn't have an official blacklist, feel free to report them at this discord link to get them added to the addon.

If you would like to help contribute to keeping the addon up to date on your realm, feel free to reach out to me on discord.

 

Typing '/beneblack' in chat will display the last time your blacklist was updated.

Typing '/beneblack check', will recheck check the party again for any blacklisted players. Will also post in party chat if anyone is on the blacklist or if your party is clear of known blacklisted players.

Typing '/beneblack silent', will enable silent mode.

Typing '/beneblack settings' will open the settings page.

 

You can also use '/classicblack' instead of '/beneblack'


Also joining any battleground will also enable silent mode.

While in silent mode, no messages will be sent in party/raid chat; but you will still recieve personal notifications of blacklisted players/guilds.
